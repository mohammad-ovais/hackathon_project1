- **LO-001**: Comprehend the foundational principles of robotics, including kinematics, dynamics, and control, as applied to AI systems.
- **LO-002**: Apply various AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, to solve complex problems in robotic perception, navigation, and manipulation.
- **LO-003**: Design and implement intelligent robotic systems capable of autonomous decision-making and interaction within dynamic environments.
- **LO-004**: Evaluate and select appropriate sensors, actuators, and computational platforms for specific robotic applications.
- **LO-005**: Analyze the ethical implications and societal impact of advanced AI robotics, promoting responsible innovation.
- **LO-006**: Develop proficiency in simulation environments and real-world robotic platforms for practical experimentation and project development.

### Target Audience

This book is intended for:

- Advanced undergraduate and graduate students in Robotics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering.
- Researchers and academics seeking a comprehensive reference on current trends and foundational aspects of AI robotics.
- Professionals and engineers transitioning into or working within the fields of AI, robotics, automation, and intelligent systems.

### Prerequisites

Readers should possess:

- A solid understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations.
- Proficiency in at least one programming language, preferably Python or C++.
- Familiarity with basic data structures and algorithms.
- An introductory knowledge of control systems and classical robotics concepts is beneficial but not strictly required, as foundational topics are reviewed.

### Book Structure

The textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the middleware framework that serves as the communication backbone for modern robotic systems.

2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explores the creation and utilization of digital twin environments for robotic systems, focusing on simulation as a critical component of the robotics development lifecycle.

3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Focuses on integrating artificial intelligence capabilities into robotic systems using NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem, covering deep learning and reinforcement learning applications.

4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Explores the integration of vision, language, and action systems to create embodied AI agents capable of understanding natural language commands and executing complex robotic tasks.

### How to Use This Textbook

Each module contains several chapters with theoretical foundations, practical applications, hands-on exercises, and programming assignments. We recommend following the modules sequentially as each builds upon the previous ones. The textbook adopts a blended pedagogical approach with:

- **Theoretical Foundations**: Each chapter begins with clear explanations of core theories and mathematical models.
- **Practical Application**: Concepts are reinforced through numerous examples, case studies, and real-world scenarios.
- **Hands-on Learning**: Programming exercises and mini-projects using popular robotics frameworks are integrated throughout.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Content is structured to build knowledge incrementally, moving from fundamental principles to advanced applications.

### Capstone Project

The textbook concludes with a comprehensive capstone project that requires students to design, implement, and evaluate an intelligent robotic system for a complex, real-world challenge, synthesizing all learned material from the previous modules.
