# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Module 2, "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)", explores the creation and utilization of digital twin environments for robotic systems. This module establishes simulation as a critical component of the robotics development lifecycle, enabling safe testing, algorithm validation, and system optimization before deployment to physical hardware. Students will master both Gazebo Classic and Unity-based simulation environments, learning to create realistic physics models, sensor simulations, and complex environments that accurately reflect real-world conditions. The module emphasizes simulation-to-reality transfer techniques, ensuring skills developed in simulation translate effectively to physical robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of Module 2, students will be able to:

- **M2-LO-001**: Design and implement realistic physics models for robotic systems in both Gazebo and Unity environments
- **M2-LO-002**: Configure and calibrate simulated sensors to match real-world sensor characteristics and noise profiles
- **M2-LO-003**: Create complex simulation environments with dynamic objects, realistic lighting, and environmental conditions
- **M2-LO-004**: Validate robotic algorithms in simulation before real-world deployment using systematic testing methodologies
- **M2-LO-005**: Implement simulation-to-reality transfer techniques to minimize the reality gap between simulated and physical systems
- **M2-LO-006**: Integrate simulation environments with ROS 2 systems for seamless development and testing workflows

## Module Structure

This module consists of six chapters that progressively build your understanding of simulation environments:

1. **Introduction to Simulation Environments** - Gazebo and Unity fundamentals
2. **Physics Modeling and Dynamics** - Creating realistic physical interactions
3. **Sensor Simulation and Calibration** - Simulating real-world sensors accurately
4. **Environment Design and Scenarios** - Building complex testing environments
5. **Simulation-to-Reality Transfer** - Bridging the sim-to-real gap
6. **Advanced Simulation Techniques** - Multi-robot systems and cloud simulation

Each chapter includes theoretical foundations, practical demonstrations, hands-on simulation labs, and exercises to reinforce learning. The module emphasizes both Gazebo and Unity environments, providing students with experience in multiple simulation platforms.

## Prerequisites

Students should have:

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (kinematics, dynamics, forces)
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts and coordinate systems
- Understanding of sensor principles (cameras, LIDAR, IMU, encoders)
- Basic knowledge of C# (for Unity components) and Python for simulation scripting
- Experience with Linux development environment

## Assessment Strategy

Module 2 includes both formative and summative assessments:

- **Formative Assessments (30%)**: Weekly simulation exercises, peer review of simulation models, and simulation performance analysis reports
- **Summative Assessments (70%)**:
  - Mid-module project: Complete robot simulation with physics and sensors (25%)
  - Final project: Complex environment with multi-sensor integration and validation (35%)
  - Technical presentation: Simulation-to-reality transfer analysis (10%)

## How This Module Feeds Into the Final Capstone

Module 2 provides the essential simulation and validation foundation for the capstone project:

1. **Development Acceleration**: Students will use simulation environments to rapidly prototype and test capstone project algorithms before real-world deployment.

2. **Risk Mitigation**: Complex capstone scenarios can be safely tested in simulation, preventing hardware damage and ensuring system reliability.

3. **Algorithm Validation**: Simulation allows for comprehensive testing of perception, planning, and control algorithms under various conditions and edge cases.

4. **Parameter Optimization**: Students can efficiently tune control parameters and system configurations in simulation before applying to real hardware.

5. **Performance Benchmarking**: Simulation provides a controlled environment for establishing performance baselines and comparing different algorithmic approaches.

The simulation skills developed in this module become essential for iterative development and validation of the capstone project, enabling students to identify and resolve issues in simulation before encountering them with physical hardware.
