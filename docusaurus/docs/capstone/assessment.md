## Assessment Overview

The capstone assessment evaluates students' ability to synthesize knowledge from all four modules into a cohesive, functional robotic system. This comprehensive evaluation measures integration skills, technical implementation, system validation, and professional communication abilities. The assessment follows a multi-component approach with portfolio evaluation, technical demonstration, and presentation components.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Evaluate comprehensive integration of all four module components",
  "Assess technical implementation and system architecture decisions",
  "Validate system performance across multiple scenarios and environments",
  "Review documentation quality and professional presentation skills",
  "Measure understanding of safety, ethics, and practical deployment considerations"
