# RAG Chatbot Integration

This page describes how the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot is integrated into the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook website.

## Overview

The chatbot allows readers to ask questions about the textbook content and receive accurate answers with citations to specific chapters and sections. It uses a combination of vector search and generative AI to provide contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English about the textbook content
- **Cited Responses**: All answers include citations to specific chapters, sections, and pages
- **Selected Text Queries**: Ask questions about specific text passages you've highlighted
- **Real-time Responses**: Answers typically returned in under 3 seconds
- **Persistent Session**: Conversation history maintained during your visit

## How It Works

The chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach:

1. Your question is converted to a numerical representation (embedding)
2. This embedding is compared against embeddings of textbook content
3. The most relevant text passages are retrieved
4. A generative AI model creates a response based on these passages
5. Citations to the original sources are included

## Privacy Notice

- No personal data is collected or stored
- Query history is kept only in your browser's memory during your session
- No tracking or analytics on your questions

## Technical Details

The chatbot is implemented as a Docusaurus plugin with:

- A React-based frontend widget
- A FastAPI backend service
- Qdrant vector database for content indexing
- Google's Gemini AI for response generation

## Troubleshooting

**Chatbot not appearing?**
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear your browser cache if problems persist

**Slow responses?**
- The service may be experiencing high load
- Try again in a few moments
- Responses may be slower during peak hours

**No relevant answers?**
- Try rephrasing your question
- Be as specific as possible
- Use terminology from the textbook when possible

## Support

If you encounter issues with the chatbot, please report them via the GitHub repository for this textbook.
